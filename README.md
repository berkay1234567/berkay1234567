# 👋 Hi, I’m Berkay Özdemir

## 💻 .NET Software Engineer | 4+ Years Experience
I am a passionate software engineer specializing in **.NET**, **C#**, backend development, and scalable system design.  
I enjoy creating clean, maintainable, and high-performance applications — from enterprise systems to personal backend projects.

I am currently looking for opportunities to **relocate to  Germany** to continue my career in a dynamic and innovative environment.

## 📂 About My GitHub Activity
Although I actively work on software projects every day, **most of my best work is done in professional environments** where the code is **private and cannot be shared publicly**.  
For this reason, my GitHub may not fully reflect the scope of my real-world experience.

I still try to upload personal projects, experiments, and learning materials whenever possible.
